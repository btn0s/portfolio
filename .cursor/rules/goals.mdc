# Portfolio Goals & Career Objectives

## Primary Purpose

This portfolio is designed to showcase my unique hybrid skillset as a design engineer with strong prototyping abilities. The primary goal is to demonstrate the intersection of design thinking and technical implementation capabilities that make me valuable for product-focused engineering roles.

## Target Roles & Companies

I'm specifically targeting roles at:

1. **Design/Engineering Tool Companies**:
   - Linear
   - Paper
   - Play
   - Similar product-focused tool startups

2. **AI Startups**:
   - Companies building innovative AI interfaces
   - Startups leveraging AI for creative or productivity tools

3. **Prototyping Roles**:
   - Meta and similar companies with dedicated prototyping teams
   - Roles that bridge design systems and engineering implementation

## Content Strategy

The portfolio is structured to highlight:

1. **Professional Work**: `/work/` directory showcasing polished, shipped projects
   - Demonstrates ability to execute at a professional level
   - Shows range across different companies and problem spaces

2. **Experimental Lab**: `/lab/` directory as an active collection of explorations
   - Maintains a backlog of creative experiments
   - Shows technical versatility and passion for exploration
   - Includes projects across diverse technologies:
     - WebGL shaders
     - AI interfaces and integrations
     - Game development prototypes
     - Interaction design experiments
     - Creative coding

## Unique Value Proposition

The portfolio aims to communicate my ability to:

1. **Bridge Disciplines**: Work effectively across design and engineering
2. **Prototype Rapidly**: Turn concepts into functional implementations quickly
3. **Execute with Quality**: Deliver polished, production-ready solutions
4. **Explore Emerging Tech**: Stay ahead of technology trends through hands-on exploration

## Lab Section Strategy

The `/lab/` section will be continuously expanded with:
