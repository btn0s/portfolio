# This I Believe

<Flicker />

I believe the best design engineers don't just build for users — they build for everyone around them. They create momentum. They reduce friction. They lay foundations that help their teams move faster, with more clarity and less noise. They're not just problem solvers — they're multipliers.

I'm a prototyper at heart. I work fast and loose to find signal in the noise. I believe iteration speed solves almost everything — not by brute force, but by making the invisible visible. Show it, don't tell it. Try it, don't assume it. But speed isn't the goal. Insight is. And insight comes from focus, intention, and having the right tools in your hands.

This is where the joy of discovery lives — in that moment when experimentation meets insight. When the right tool unlocks a new way of thinking. When rapid iteration reveals not just what works, but why it matters.

Tools matter. A lot. The best tools don't just get out of your way — they work with you. They respond to your thinking. They shape how you explore, how you design, and how you build. Expressive tools aren't luxuries — they're accelerants. They close the gap between idea and execution.

I believe in systems that empower. In workflows that flex. In code as a medium for expression — not just instruction. Declarative paradigms, visual languages, real-time feedback: these aren't just nice-to-haves. They're how we unlock new ways of thinking.

And I believe in raising the floor for everyone.
In sharing knowledge, not hoarding it.
In designing not just for the end user — but for the teammate, the future contributor, the person inheriting your work six months from now.

The future of software is being rewritten. AI is reshaping how we work, who gets to build, and what building even means. That future should be more accessible, more expressive, more playful — and more human.

Let's make things that move fast and feel right.
Let's build tools that help ideas grow.
Let's design the future we actually want to work in.
