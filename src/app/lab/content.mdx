# My Lab

This is where I prototype, explore, and push boundaries. Each experiment here is a step toward more expressive tools and more intuitive interfaces. Some are rough around the edges, others more polished â€“ but all embody my belief that the best way to predict the future is to build it, one iteration at a time.
