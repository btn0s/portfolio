## Overview

American Express serves over 100 million cardmembers globally as a premier Fortune 100 financial services company. Their customer care infrastructure handles millions of daily interactions across mobile, web, and voice channels.

I joined the AskAmex organization during a pivotal transformation period, where I led a diverse team of engineers to modernize their customer service ecosystem. Working in close collaboration with product and design teams, we successfully balanced feature delivery with foundational improvements to development practices.

My most significant contribution was TimeMachine — an innovative bridge system I designed that became the cornerstone of our modernization strategy. What began as an experimental solution evolved into mission-critical infrastructure, enabling teams throughout the organization to confidently build and deploy features while maintaining stability.

## Key Achievements

- **Leadership Excellence**: Directed a multidisciplinary team of full-time engineers and contractors, implementing robust processes that enhanced code quality and deployment confidence.

- **Product Innovation**: Collaborated with product and design teams to create intuitive UI patterns for complex customer interactions, successfully launching the travel vertical to over 300 specialized agents.

- **Technical Innovation**: Led initiatives that transformed development practices, creating TimeMachine—a bi-directional bridge system that enabled teams to build new features with modern React technology without rebuilding the existing Angular platform, maintaining 99.9% reliability while modernizing critical customer-facing systems.

- **Process Transformation**: Established streamlined validation workflows with specialized agents, significantly reducing post-deployment issues and elevating overall feature quality.
