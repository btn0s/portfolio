# I led the development of a global brand collaboration with Post Malone.

Backbone collaborated with Post Malone to create a limited-edition controller. I worked on design and led development of the partnership page on our NextJS and headless Shopify site. This was a high-profile project that required close collaboration with the brand and design teams, and in the end sold out in less than 2 minutes.
