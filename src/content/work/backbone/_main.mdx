## Overview
Backbone is transforming mobile gaming through premium controllers and seamless software experiences. Our products reached #1 on the App Store during Christmas 2023 and are now sold globally.

### My roles
**Senior Design Engineer, Labs (current)** <br/>

I founded and led Backbone Labs, a design engineering team focused on rapid validation, internal tooling, and independent project delivery. My team has been instrumental in building the company's design system, streamlining the design workflow, and delivering high-impact projects that directly drive business results.

**Senior Frontend Engineer, Web/Ecommerce** <br/>

As the second engineer on the web team, I architected critical systems that scaled Backbone from startup to global brand. Working with Next.js and headless Shopify, I developed a robust platform now serving customers worldwide.

## Key Achievements

- **Platform Architecture**: Led development of Backbone's global ecommerce platform, building systems that significantly increased revenue through optimized landing pages and smart cart features

- **Team Leadership**: Founded and led Backbone Labs, establishing the company's design engineering practice and creating a culture of rapid iteration and technical excellence

- **Developer Experience**: Built critical infrastructure including a Figma plugin reducing design handoff time by 80% and staging environments that accelerated deployment confidence

- **Brand Growth**: Executed development for partnerships with PlayStation, Kojima Productions, and Post Malone, expanding market reach and strengthening brand positioning
