# I led front-end development of a global-scale ecommerce store, and established the company's design engineering practice.

Backbone is revolutionizing mobile gaming through premium controllers and seamless software experiences. As an early member of the web team, I helped scale backbone.com from startup to global brand. Later, I founded Labs—the company's first design engineering team—to accelerate product innovation.

Today, Backbone's products are sold worldwide and have reached #1 on the App Store in both 2023 and 2024.

## My Impact

**Senior Design Engineer, Labs** (current)
- Founded and led Backbone's first design engineering team (3 generalists, direct report to CEO)
- Created a rapid prototyping practice working upstream of core product teams
- Designed and developed internal tools, like a Figma plugin for game metadata
- Delivered full-stack solutions spanning multiple products
- Collaborated closely with design, product, and UX research to refine early-stage concepts

**Senior Frontend Engineer, Web** (2021-2024)
- Led front-end UI engineering for backbone.com
- Architected high-performance, scalable web experiences
- Designed and developed the site's most complex features, including PDPs and checkout (using NextJS and headless Shopify)
- Spearheaded high-profile brand collaborations with PlayStation, Post Malone, Death Stranding, and Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile
