Backbone is transforming mobile gaming through premium controllers and seamless software experiences. As an early member of the web team, I helped scale backbone.com from startup to global brand. Later, I founded Labs—the company's first design engineering team—to accelerate product innovation.

Today, Backbone's products are sold worldwide and reached #1 on the App Store in both 2023 and 2024.
