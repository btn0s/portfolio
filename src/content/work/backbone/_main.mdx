# I led front-end development of a global-scale ecommerce store, and established the company's design engineering practice.

Backbone is transforming mobile gaming through premium controllers and seamless software experiences. As an early member of the web team, I helped scale backbone.com from startup to global brand. Later, I founded Labs—the company's first design engineering team—to accelerate product innovation.

Today, Backbone's products are sold worldwide and reached #1 on the App Store in both 2023 and 2024. 

**My roles:**

**Senior Design Engineer, Labs** (current)

I founded the company's first design engineering team, Labs, to work upstream of the core team and accelerate product innovation. We autonomously led projects that spanned across the company, and scross the stack. We primarily focused on working closely with design, product, and UXR to test and refine early-stage product work, but also shipped to production in a full stack capacity. I led a team of 3 engineers. 

**Senior Frontend Engineer, Web** (2021-2024)

I was the front-end UI engineering lead for backbone.com, and was responsible for the site's performance, scalability, and user experience. I helped designed and led development on the site's most complex features, including the product detail page and checkout flow. I also led the development of high-profile collaboration expereinces such as PlayStation, Post Malone, Death Stranding, and Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile.
