## Overview

Backbone is transforming mobile gaming through premium controllers and seamless software experiences. Our products reached #1 on the App Store during Christmas 2023 and are now sold globally.

Over my time at backbone I played two distinct roles:<br/>

**Senior Design Engineer, Labs (current)** <br/>

I founded and led Backbone Labs, a design engineering team focused on rapid validation, internal tooling, and independent project delivery.

**Senior Frontend Engineer, Web/Ecommerce** <br/>

As the second engineer on the web team, I helped scale Backbone.com from DTC startup to global brand.
