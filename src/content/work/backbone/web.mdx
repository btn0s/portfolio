# I led front-end development on the global Backbone.com ecommerce site.

I joined Backbone in 2021 as the second engineer on the web team. I ran multiple projects across the site over the course of 3 years before moving on to found the company's design engineering practice.

<Button asChild variant={"secondary"} className="not-prose" size={"sm"}>

</Button>

### My Impact

- Built a Game Detail page template system that connected to our Games DB and allowed us to expand the SEO surface of our site by roughly 10,000 pages
- Built a new PDP template system using NextJS and headless Shopify that allowed us to launch new products 2x faster
- Led development of multiple high-profile brand collaborations, including PlayStation, Post Malone, Death Stranding, and Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile
- Built a custom cart system on top of Shopify's cart API
- Built a custom upsell system that allowed us to show relevant products to users based on their cart
