# Sobol

Sobol is a platform for visualizing and coordinating decentralized organizations through roles, teams, and treasury tools. As a UI Engineer, I helped build the early design system and played a key role in the transition to Sobol 2.0, refining the productâ€™s structure and interaction patterns.
