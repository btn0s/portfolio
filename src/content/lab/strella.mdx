# The IDE Reimagined for Design-Technologists

![Strella Interface Concept](placeholder.png)

## My Journey

Throughout my career spanning both design and development, I've constantly felt the friction of switching between tools. I'd sketch interfaces in one tool, prototype in another, and then rebuild everything in code. This fragmented workflow always felt like a fundamental problem that shouldn't exist.

I've always been captivated by Unreal Engine Blueprints' approach to visual scripting—it's incredibly powerful, intuitive, and accessible. Every time I use it, I find myself thinking: "Why doesn't something like this exist for UI design?" I've spent countless hours imagining what this could look like for web and product development.

Strella is my exploration of that question—a personal vision of what might be possible if we reimagined the IDE specifically for people who live at the intersection of design and code.

## The Blueprint Moment

The first time I connected nodes in Unreal Engine Blueprints, I had that magical "aha" moment. Complex behavior materialized through visual connections rather than abstract text. It was a revelation—watching my ideas come to life by connecting nodes, seeing the flow of data and logic visually, and experiencing how intuitive programming could be when freed from the constraints of text.

Blueprints showed me that visual programming doesn't have to mean sacrificing power or flexibility. Instead, it made advanced programming concepts more accessible by mapping them to a visual system that resonated with how I think. The ability to trace execution paths visually, to see values propagate through the system in real-time, and to understand complex behaviors at a glance fundamentally changed how I thought about programming interfaces.

What makes Blueprints truly magical for a prototyper like me is how it transforms the entire creation workflow. I can rapidly experiment without worrying about build processes, compilation, or code syntax. The graph becomes my playground for quick iterations and explorations. But here's the real game-changer: developers and I work in the **same environment with the same artifacts**. What I create isn't a throwaway mockup—it's the actual foundation that developers can incrementally build upon.

This eliminates the energy-draining handoff process we've all become accustomed to: writing PRDs in Notion, translating those into Figma designs, and then having developers recreate everything from scratch in code. Each translation loses fidelity and wastes effort. Blueprints showed me a better way—where what I prototype is what ships, just refined and expanded by the team.

While tools like Quartz Composer, Origami Studio, Framer, Play (@createwithplay), and even Dreamweaver all taught me something unique about the intersection of design and code, none captured that same feeling of creative flow that Blueprints provided. Each solved part of the puzzle, but I've never found one that truly united design and development workflows in the way I experienced with Blueprints.

## What I'm Exploring

In Strella, I'm exploring three core capabilities:

- A **node-based visual scripting** system that makes complex logic accessible through visual connections
- **Vector-based design tools** that provide precise control over the visual layer
- A **universal runtime** that renders across platforms without translation loss

The goal is a single environment where I could move fluidly between design and code—where the distinction between them starts to blur. 

Crucially, I believe this tool must be **open source and deeply customizable**. Design engineers have widely varying workflows and requirements—no single tool configuration can satisfy everyone. By making Strella open source, anyone could modify and extend it to match their unique needs. Want specialized nodes for your design system? Add them. Need integration with proprietary tools? Build it. The goal isn't just another tool, but a platform where design-technologists can craft their ideal environment.

## Where I'm At

For now, Strella exists as concept wireframes, architecture diagrams, and lots of notes. I'm slowly working toward a functional prototype of the node editor, focusing first on making the visual scripting intuitive yet powerful.

This exploration represents my deeper belief about tools: that high-fidelity prototyping shouldn't require choosing between design tools and code. As someone who's worked across both domains, I'm convinced there's a better way—and Strella is my attempt to imagine what that could be.

In the end, Strella is a love letter to Unreal Engine—a tribute to how Blueprints fundamentally changed my understanding of what programming interfaces could be. While I've learned from many tools along the way, it was Unreal that showed me a truly unified, visual approach to creation that respects both designers and developers. Strella is my way of saying "thank you" by bringing that same magic to the world of product design.
