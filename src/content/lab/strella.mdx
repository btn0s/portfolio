## The Fragmentation Problem: Design and Code in Separate Worlds

Throughout my career, I've struggled with fragmented design and development tools. Sketching in one tool, prototyping in another, and rebuilding in code isn't just inefficient—it's a fundamental workflow problem.

As someone with hybrid skills, this fragmentation is especially painful. I'm constantly forced to context switch between mental models and express ideas in incompatible languages—design thinking in one tool, engineering logic in another. Each transition breaks flow and dilutes vision, never allowing my skillset to work as a unified whole.

A few years ago, I started using Unreal Engine as a hobby to explore game design ideas. What I discovered changed everything. This was the first environment where my designer and engineer sides worked seamlessly together, letting me reach a flow state that utilized both halves of my skillset. Ever since then, I've wondered: "Why doesn't something like this exist in my line of work?"

Strella is my exploration of that question.

## The Blueprint Moment

The first time I opened Blueprints, something clicked—like finding a puzzle piece I hadn't realized was missing. Here was a tool that didn't force me to translate between design and code—it embraced both simultaneously. For the first time, I felt truly understood as someone with a hybrid skillset. This moment changed how I want to work.

My first experience with Blueprints was revelatory. Watching behaviors materialize through visual connections felt like magic. Instead of writing abstract text, I connected nodes to create logic, saw data flow visually, and experienced programming freed from syntax constraints.

What makes Blueprints extraordinary isn't just its visual nature—it transforms the entire creation process. I can rapidly experiment without build cycles or compilation delays. The real breakthrough: developers and I work in the **same environment with the same artifacts**. My prototypes aren't throwaway mockups—they're the foundation developers build upon.

This eliminates the energy-draining handoff cycle of Notion PRDs → Figma designs → code, where each translation loses fidelity. Blueprints offers something better—what I prototype is what ships, just refined by the team.

## How I Think This Could Work

The experience with Blueprints left me with a question: What if we could bring this same unified approach to product design? After years of working in fragmented toolchains, I began envisioning a system built specifically for design engineers.

Strella embodies this vision—inspired by Blueprints but reimagined for the unique challenges of product design. It would unite three capabilities that have always existed separately:

### Unified Visual Scripting

Blueprint's greatest strength is how it makes complex logic accessible while preserving programming power. Strella would offer a node-based system where designers connect visual elements that represent code constructs. This isn't just about making programming easier—it's about creating a new language that speaks to both design and engineering mindsets simultaneously.

  className="rounded-sm shrink-0 bg-muted border shadow"
/>

The visual nature makes relationships explicit. Data flows become tangible paths you can follow with your eyes. Complex behaviors emerge from simple connections. And critically, everything remains turing-complete—there's no ceiling to what you can build.

### Precision Design Tools

For design fidelity, Strella would integrate vector-based tools inspired by systems like Rive and Figma. This allows for pixel-perfect control while maintaining resolution independence.

  alt="Strella Page View Design"
  width={1600}
  height={900}
  className="rounded-sm shrink-0 bg-muted border shadow"
/>

But the breakthrough comes from how these design elements connect directly to the node system. When you adjust a visual property, you're modifying the same artifact that drives the functional behavior. There's no translation layer in between—the design is the implementation.

### Live, Universal Runtime

The system would provide instant previews across platforms, enabling rapid testing and iteration. Changes to both design and logic would appear immediately in context, allowing you to see exactly how your work behaves in real-time.

  alt="Strella Project View Design"
  width={1600}
  height={900}
  className="rounded-sm shrink-0 bg-muted border shadow"
/>

This runtime would allow for true cross-platform prototyping. The same definition could render natively on web, iOS, Android, or desktop—ensuring that fidelity carries through to every environment.

### Open Source & Extensible by Design

Crucially, all of this must be **open source and deeply customizable**. No single configuration can satisfy the diverse needs of every design engineer. The system should be extensible at every level—from adding custom nodes to creating specialized tools for specific product domains.

## Where I'm At

The wireframes you see here are all that exist for now. Strella is in its conceptual phase, with these initial designs representing the vision rather than a working product. I'm currently working on prototyping various pieces of the UX and will publish those here as they develop.

This project stems from my belief that high-fidelity prototyping shouldn't require compromising between design tools and code. Having worked as both a designer and engineer, I'm convinced a unified approach is not only possible but necessary.

In the end, Strella is a love letter to Unreal Engine—a tribute to how Blueprints changed my understanding of what programming interfaces could be. While I've learned from many tools, it was Unreal that showed me a unified approach to creation that respects both designers and developers. Strella is my way of bringing that same magic to product design.
