# Strella: The Visual Development Environment

Strella is a new kind of tool—a Visual Development Environment (VDE) where layout, logic, and state come together in a single canvas. Inspired by Unreal Engine’s <Link href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blueprints</Link>, Strella is built for design engineers: people who think visually but build interactively. It replaces the Figma-to-code pipeline with a unified authoring system—no handoff, no translation, no loss of intent.

## The Origin Story

The seed for Strella was planted late one night, while playing with Unreal Engine’s Blueprints. For years, I had lived between two worlds—design and engineering—switching between tools that didn’t speak the same language. But Blueprints changed that. I could see logic. Follow data. Build behavior in a way that felt immediate, expressive, and powerful.

It was the first time I felt like I wasn’t *translating* ideas—I was simply expressing them.

That moment unlocked something: the idea that maybe UI development didn’t have to live in a code editor at all. Maybe we could have tools where visual thinkers and engineers *start* in the same space—not convert between them.

## The Gap Today

The problem isn’t just that our tools are separate—it’s that they ask us to think in fragments. Visual structure lives in Figma. Logic and behavior live in code. You spend time writing specs, prototyping flows, then rebuilding them in code—all while your mental model shifts between systems.

That translation tax is real. And it adds up.

In contrast, Blueprints offered something rare: a space where prototyping and production happened in the same medium. You didn’t lose fidelity moving from idea to implementation. There was no throwaway work. Just continuous evolution.

That’s the spirit Strella is built on.

## What Strella Is

Strella is the first IDE designed specifically for design engineers. It combines:

### Visual Scripting, Fully Executable

A node-based graph editor for building real product logic—conditionals, loops, state, event flows. Everything is Turing complete. You can wire up logic without writing code, but without losing any expressive power.

### A Layout-First Design Surface

A visual editor for constructing component structure—just like Figma or Framer. But this isn’t a static mockup. These elements are live. Every visual change is reflected in your component’s rendered output and graph bindings.

/>

### A Runtime That Stays in Sync

The system is always live. Changes in the graph or design surface update the preview instantly. You can trigger flows, test interactions, or simulate data in real-time—without rebuilding or redeploying anything.

### Real Components, No Translation

Every graph is a real component. Components can be nested, reused, or composed visually. Props are passed via ports. State is managed visually. When you create a new component, you’re not making a prototype—you’re defining behavior and structure at the same time.

### Extensible by Default

Strella is being built as an open system. You’ll be able to add custom node types, define reusable subgraphs, and extend the environment to fit your team’s mental model—whether that’s product flows, games, data tools, or creative tooling.

## Where Things Stand

Strella is a bet on a better kind of tool. One that doesn't just help you work, but helps you think. One that removes the artificial gap between design and implementation. One that makes software creation visual, expressive, and collaborative from the start.

Right now, Strella is in prototype. The core execution engine works. The graph runtime is functional. The ideas are in motion. What’s next is polish, iteration, and putting it in the hands of the right people.
