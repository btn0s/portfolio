# Echelon

Inspired by Splinter Cell's multiplayer, Echelon is a prototype I built to explore asymmetrical stealth gameplay. The concept pits agile spies against well-armed mercenaries, where spies use stealth and gadgets while mercenaries rely on firepower to control the map. This project let me experiment with multiplayer game mechanics and the interesting balance challenges that come with asymmetrical player abilities.

{[coverImg, mainMenuImg, menuWireframeImg, prematchImg, matchStartSpiesImg, damageMercImg, eliminatedImg, repeatImg].map(img => (
    <Image
        key={img.src}
        src={img}
        alt="Echelon UX board"
        width={1600}
        height={900}
        className="rounded-sm shrink-0 bg-muted border shadow aspect-video"
    />
))}
