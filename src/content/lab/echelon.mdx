# Echelon

Echelon is a personal project I worked on prototyping - an asymmetrical multiplayer game inspired by classic spies-vs-mercs gameplay. Players choose between stealthy spies or heavily armed mercenaries, each with distinct abilities and objectives. The game combines strategic planning phases with real-time action, emphasizing teamwork and creative problem-solving.
