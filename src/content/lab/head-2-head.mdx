# Head 2 Head

Head 2 head is a multiplayer FPS game concept I designed and prototyped in Unreal Engine Blueprints. This game is inspired by the "Arena" from the popular S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, as well as the 1v1 "Gulag" or 2v2 "Gunfight" from recent Call of Duty games.

        if (item.type === "image") {

                <Image
                    key={item.src.src}
                    src={item.src}
